This is a game made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2. This is my first, complete, game made using the Godot game engine. Its a game where you can Record, Rewind, Fast-Forward time at your will.
 
  Made using:
  - Godot Game Engine.
  - C# programming engine.
  - Bfxr for sound effects.
  - Aseprite for pixel art.
